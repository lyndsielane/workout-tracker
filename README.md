## Workout Tracker

# About
A full-stack application that tracks a users workouts and provides data tables with the lifetime information. The user is able to create a workout and input exercise data. The complete button on the exercise entry page will save the data and take the user back to the homepage while the continue button allows for more exercise entry. The homepage offers a continue workout button which allows more exercises to be entered on the current workout. The new workout button clears the previous workout data and begins tracking the user's exercise entries. 
The homepage shows the stats of the last workout including:
    * date
    * total workout duration
    * exercises performed
    * total weight lifted
    * total sets performed
    * total reps performed
There is also a Dashboard page that shows lifetime information in graph format. The first graph displays total workout duration in minutes and the second displays total pounds.
